# Welcome to the Book Library System
The Book Library System is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use application designed to cater to the needs of students and teachers who wish to borrow books from their educational institution's library. Whether you are a student looking to dive into a new world of knowledge or a teacher in search of valuable resources, our system ensures a seamless and fair book lending process.

Overview
The Book Library System provides two flexible implementations to meet the diverse needs of its users. Each implementation offers a unique approach to book lending, ensuring equitable access to resources:

Implementation 1: Priority-based Lending
In this implementation, the library follows a priority system to manage book requests:

Teachers: Teachers are given the highest priority. If a teacher requests a book, they will be prioritized over students.
Senior Students: If a senior student requests a book, they will be prioritized over junior students.
First-Come-First-Serve: In the absence of priority conflicts, books are distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Implementation 2: First-Come-First-Serve for All
In this implementation, the library operates on a simpler first-come, first-serve basis. Regardless of your role (teacher, senior student, or junior student), books are distributed purely based on the order of your request.

# Getting Started
To make the most of the Book Library System, follow these steps:

Login: If you are a new user, create an account by providing your credentials. Existing users can log in using their username and password.

Browse Books: Explore the library's extensive collection. You can search for books by title, author, genre, or keywords.

Book Request: Once you find a book you'd like to borrow, request it through the system. Specify whether you are a teacher, senior student, or junior student.

Priority Rules (Implementation 1): If you are using Implementation 1, the priority system will ensure fair access to books. The librarian will allocate books based on your priority and the order of your request.

First-Come-First-Serve (Implementation 2): In Implementation 2, books are distributed solely based on the order of your request, regardless of your role.

Book Availability: If the requested book is available, it will be issued to you. If not, the system will return a 'Book Taken' message.

Enjoy Reading: Once you have the book, enjoy your reading. You can keep it for a predefined duration, after which you will need to return it to the library.

Returning Books: Return the borrowed book to the library within the specified time to maintain a fair and accessible library for all users.
